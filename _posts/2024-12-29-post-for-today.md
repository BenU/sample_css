Nearly every morning I crank out some [morning pages](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman).  I enjoy them. They seem to process and diffuse distracting thoughts.  They also grease the wheels of my mind's writing and creating circuits.  I notice that I write faster when I'm in the habbit of daily morning pages.  That said, I wish that I had a better morning and daily routine.  A routine after which I look back over my day and feel like I've learned some interesting stuff, maybe created some good things of use in the world, maintained order and beauty in my surroundings and spent time with people I love and whose company I enjoy.  I haven't gotten there yet or anything close to it.  But maybe I'm making progress.  Maybe I'm getting ready to get ready to get closer to that.  

Stay tuned.  I'll report back, if not on this site, then another sort of like it.
