Nearly every morning I crank out some [morning pages](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman) which I enjoy in that they seem to process and diffuse distracting thoughts as well as grease the wheels of my mind's writing and creating circuits.  I wish that I had a better morning and daily routine but haven't gotten there yet.
